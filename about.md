Hello and welcome!

I'm so glad you could join me. I'm your Blog host, Adam Bourg. I'm typing this in a deep announcer voice. The topic of this blog is life hacks to refactor your software development career.

I never had a mentor in my career, I've basically fumbled around, read a few really great books but overall I've lacked the focus and clarity an experienced mentor can provide.

I'm offering my decade plus of development experience to any who wish to listen, complain and otherwise be entertained by my ramblings. I've coached many junior developers right out of training camps and presently I'm a team lead building awesome stuff in the internet industry space... secrete stuff, oh wow he's a fancy cool hat man. :)

My focus is on the soft skills, but with some javascript or other technical wizkid magic mixed right in. My current technology stack boils down to:

* Java
* React / Javascript 6 / Redux
* Ruby / Rails / Some basic Elixir

I'm not a jack of all trades, my focus right now is building my team to deliver. I love ES6 as of the time of this writing, despise poorly written Ruby 1.9.3 p.5.4.3.7, very specific I know, but it is a mess. My job right now is to take that mess, build a robust java buzz word micro service buzz word platform around it, with a buzz word react buzz word javascript 6 buzz word of the day UI that does some buzz wordy thing to make some people happy.

When not working a strict 40 hours a week (unless its vacation!), I like to ski, pet my dog, cook, box at my local gym and workout. My favorite activity of all is hanging out with my wife everyday and night.

You'll often find me in Denver drinking way too much coffee, being far too excited about randomness and being a "chatty elephant" as my friend Mark K. would call say.

This blog is hosted on Amazon S3 and built with the robust DOS safe (hopefully) static engine service; Jekyll. If you want to say hello, complain or mail me coffee products, please drop a line below.
