It's a new year and many of us have set and forgot our new years resolutions. One of the challenges I have is to have a grateful and content attitude. In this field we get to experience some of the best perks of the modern life: the internet, building cool stuff, working for cool companies and cool rewards like big pay checks.

In the next few posts we plan to look at how we can foster a culture of happiness in our organizations and most importantly in ourselves.

# Happiness starts in your head

No matter your situation, there is something positive about your life. Starting with the most obvious, you're reading this on an electronic device connected to the Internet. Sounds silly, but when work or life gets hard I start at the very basics about what I can come up with:

* I have a job that pays on time
* I get to buy a latte / americano everyday from the coffee shop across the street
* I get to use a Macbook to do my job

The goal is to document 3-4 unique items that I can be grateful for and appreciate. With that thought it can short circuit your negative thinking to quickly generating a list of 10 or more items that you're really, freaking happy about.

# Gratitude changes your attitude

Within almost any part of everyday there is something you can be grateful about. Being grateful helps you change your perspective and realize that in spite of the daily problems or challenges we all face that there are things we can be happy about.

I find that when I journal about the moments in my life that bring me joy, such as getting coffee with a friend at work or eating food at that new restaurant in town; my focus changes and my mood brightens. My interactions with other people improve and its easier to interact. Even Oprah (ref 1) recommends keeping a daily gratitude journal.

# Gratitude is backed by research
Back in 2014 Forbes (Ref 2) compiled a list of scientific sources confirming that gratitude improves physical health, enhances empathy, and improves sleep. Harvard (Ref 3) has researched and shown a connection between gratitude and individual happiness. Harvard recommends keeping a gratitude journal, mediating and/or praying and thanking coworkers

# Gratitude is most effective as a regular habit

I find that gratefulness has the most positive outcome on my life when it's a daily habit. I make this habit happen everyday at work, I have it scheduled and I fill out an Excel Spreadsheet with 4 items as required, each with the same date and a short description.

The table looks like:

# Gratitude should also be external

Gratitude should foster a happier attitude and outlook on life. It's impact on your health and well being is wonderfully helpful to you. Imagine the impact your better attitude could have on other people? How could you express Gratitude towards other people?

Ideas:

* Write thank you notes to specific people or team members you appreciate
* Add a recognition section to your retrospectives
* Publicly thank people at your standup
* Private thank people by taking them to coffee and/or lunch
