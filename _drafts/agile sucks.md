The Agile Manifesto, the document that breathes life to our development organizations, was designed by people who wanted to change their industry. It is a noble cause, it is a just cause; it just didn't work.

# What is the manifesto? 

> We are uncovering better ways of developing
> software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:
>
> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
>
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
>
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
>
> **Responding to change** over following a plan  
> That is, while there is value in the items on
> the right, we value the items on the left more.

# Why is Agile Broken?

## People don't effectively interact

People, all people, the team, management, and the customer don't effectively interact. There's a complete disconnect at all levels. The first value is 'Individuals and interactions', we lose this in the religion of Scrum or XP. It's totally stripped from us whenever we visit the cermony of sprint planning, sprint review, retrospectives, grooming, and standup. 

All of these things are "processes" to facilate conversation and interactions. When was the last time you left a planning session or grooming session feeling empowered and ready to conquer the day? These meetings are a cheap subsititue for true Agile. To be truly agile, you value real, honest communication with people regaurdless of the nominclature, title or role. 

At the cermonies we have our normal rountie, the scrum master or team lead kicks off the meeting. Then people commit to their availability (some teams), then open the backlog to start "grooming" the stories. There's the pointing scale, is it LOE, time to complete, t-shirts or fibonacci? Every team does it slightly differently, hence why we need to coordinate in a scrum of scrums to get every team on the same page. 

When was the last standup you left and felt like it was better then a status meeting? 

## Teams aren't empowered

Does the problem set make more sense to build in Elixir or Go? Well, the company only will support Java. Sorry, we know that you can get better productivity, better scale and even more amazing security by chosing the best technology, but we can't let you chose that. We only pick technologies that make sense for what we can hire in the local market at the cheapest price. Sure hope you don't mind PHP! 

Worse yet, many companies won't accept their own highly paid software engineer's feedback on the process, tooling or let alone technology to use. 

Want to change how we conduct status meetings? Nope. This is the way we do it, because it's effective. 

## The customer never bought in the first place

When was the last time you, the developer, got to talk to the customer? I don't mean a business analyist. I mean the person in marketing or product that says "We need this product to do xyz". Thats the person who needs to be bought in, thats the person who needs to understand the agile process. Thats the person you need to be getting as much feedback as quickly as possible.

This is who your 'real' client is, not your manager or boss, but these people. Who is paying your group to build stuff? Who is asking for this stuff? Can they explain why they need it, justify it to you? Can they explain it so it makes sense to you? Can you  

## Management 

To often teams and many companies get stuck in their way of doing things. When new people come onboard and aren't familar with the process it can be hetic to get up to speed. Not only that, but often time teams have norms and standards around how they conduct themselves and they don't want to get better. 

# What we can do to fix Agile

# Empowered Teams
# Engaged Customers
# The team has support 
# Using better tools
