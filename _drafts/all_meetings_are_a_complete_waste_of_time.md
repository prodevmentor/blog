Lets be honest, all meetings a complete and terrible waste of time. 


Outline:
* Intro, complain complain, compare contrast then jump into meat of blog post
* Set an agenda
** Make it no more then 3 items
* Don't make it longer then an hour without breaks
* Devs hate meetings like you hate getting a cold
* How to make meetings better:
** Have a river guide / meeting manager
** Define the note taker role 
** Have a SMART goal / agenda
** Rinse repeat
* Closing thoughts

Misc crap to talk about: 

* River guide. Typically we rotate through dev's to act as the river guide, running the timers, moderating the conversation and helping us stay on topic.
* Note taker for action items and feedback to management. This person typically is rotated each meeting but brings a laptop to take notes for immedate publishing to management or the dev team.
