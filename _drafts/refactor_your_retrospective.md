Retros are a complete waste of time. Have you ever said or thought that? I certinally have, I don't need another meeting or time to drink beer to complain about work. That's what happy hour is for!

Retros can be effective means to help the team fix the process and bond. But often I find my coworkers are getting drunk and wasting precious time complaining about things that can't ever change. How do I make retros better?

# How to shift the focus

Retros are typically, sad face, happy face and netural face. Some places use pluses, minuses and neturals. These are ineffective targets for retros that lead to whining and complaining rather then focusing on making the work better. We can do better then the emoji driven retro. 

# The 5 questions you need to ask at every retro

The *first* question is "What do we need to stop doing?". This is always followed by an example of behavior we want to change: 
* Stop coming to standup late
* Stop committing code without tests
* Stop yelling when you're angry

The *second* question is "What do we need to start doing?". Such as:
* Start code review by checking out the branch locally
* Coming to meetings on time 
* Asking for help when you're stuck

The *third* question is "What do we need to continue doing?". This is criticual for the team, it helps recogonize when the team is doing something well that someone thinks should continue occuring. 
* Continue pairing and offering to pair
* Continue setting agendas for meetings

The *forth* question is "Who do you want to recognize on the team?". This is powerful because it shifts the focus from "me" to "us". It helps people see the project from the point of view of how others contributed and were apart of the success of the team. 

The *fifth* question is directed to be received by management, this should be able to be communicated to management to give them insight on how to improve things that are outside the locus of the team's control. "What feedback do you have to management?"
* We need better IT support because the firewall is blocking us from installing new modules
* We need the business to agree to a date

# The people

We have a few different people in this meeting. Managers are never welcome (they may come as we are powerless to stop them), but generally this is who is at the meeting: 

* Product owners, scrum masters and Business analytists. In our org these are all 1 person. But in others these maybe many people or roles. 
* Developers and QA.
* Designers (optional in our org)
* River guide. Typically we rotate through dev's to act as the river guide, running the timers, moderating the conversation and helping us stay on topic.
* Note taker for action items and feedback to management. This person typically is rotated each meeting but brings a laptop to take notes for immedate publishing to management or the dev team. 

# The format

We write these 5 items on a white board as "start", "stop", "continue", "feedback" and "recognitions". We give the team between 7 and 10 minutes, handout sticky notes and markers to everyone on the team. We let them be heads down focused for this interval, when the clock is up, everyone rushes up and puts their items in the right category. 

The river guide briefly grooms and groups relevent items together, then starting with recognitions we go through each category. Typically recognitions are short followed by feedback. The ones that often take the longest amount of time is the stop and start categories. 

The river guide will read each item, ask the writer(s) to provide their clarity on the feedback on the item then the note taker will mark down whatever the action item or out come was that was important.

# The enviroment

We've tried this at a bar, resturant and by far the best is in the office, just before lunch on a Friday. While Pivotal recommends 4pm on Friday, I think this is a terrible idea. Everyone should talk, vent, get things out there then the team should go to lunch. 

# I need an escape goat

The ideal here is to talk about problems, not people. Please do not make this meeting about John. Johnny this, Johnny that. The meeting is about the process and the project, not individuals rather the collective. 

# Closing thoughts

These questions are helpful and powerful because it focuses on the changable. Its about the project and software, the things that can be effected by the people in the room. It's not about snacks or the enviroment of the office. Its about recoginzing the problems and then addressing the problems with honest, constructive feedback.
