"Retros are a complete waste of time." Have you ever said or thought that? I certainly have - I don't need another meeting or time to drink beer to complain about work. That's what happy hour is for!

Retros can be effective means to help the team fix the process and bond. But, sometimes teams can get caught in the trap of getting drunk and wasting precious time complaining about things that can't ever change. How do I make retros better?

# How to shift the focus

Retros typically follow the framework of sad face, happy face, and neutral face. Some places use pluses, minuses, and neutrals. These are ineffective targets for retros that lead to whining and complaining rather then focusing on making the work better. We can do better then the emoji driven retro.

# The 5 questions you need to ask at every retro

The *first* question is "What do we need to stop doing?" This is always followed by an example of a behavior we want to change:
* Stop coming to stand up late
* Stop committing code without tests
* Stop yelling when you're angry

The *second* question is "What do we need to start doing?"
This could be:
* Start code review by checking out the branch locally
* Coming to meetings on time
* Asking for help when you're stuck

The *third* question is "What do we need to continue doing?"
 This is critical for the team, as it helps recognize when the team is doing something well that someone thinks should continue occurring.
* Continue pairing and offering to pair
* Continue setting agendas for meetings

The *forth* question is "Who do you want to recognize on the team?". This is powerful because it shifts the focus from "me" to "us." It helps people see the project from the point of view of how others contributed and were a part of the success of the team.

The *fifth* question is designed to be received by management, and it should be communicated to management to give them insight on how to improve things that are outside the locus of the team's control.
"What feedback do you have for management?"
* We need better IT support because the firewall is blocking us from installing new modules
* We need the business to agree to a date for _________.

# The people

We have a few different people in this meeting. Managers are not typically invited  (but they may come as we are powerless to stop them), but generally this is who is at the meeting:

* Product owners, scrum masters, and business analysts. In our org these titles are all one person, but in others these maybe many people or roles.
* Developers and QA.
* Designers (optional in our org).
* River guide. Typically we rotate through devs to act as the river guide - running the timers, moderating the conversation, and helping us stay on topic.
* Note taker for action items and feedback to management. This person typically is rotated each meeting but brings a laptop to take notes for immediate publishing to management or the dev team.

# The format

We write these 5 items on a white board as "start," "stop," "continue," "feedback," and "recognitions." We give the team between 7 and 10 minutes and hand out sticky notes and markers to everyone on the team. We let them be heads down focused for this interval. When the clock is up, everyone rushes up and puts their items in the right category.

The river guide briefly grooms and groups relevant items together. Then, starting with "recognitions", we go through each category. Typically "recognitions" are short and followed by "feedback". The ones that often take the longest amount of time are the "stop" and "start" categories.

The river guide will read each item, ask the writer(s) to provide their clarity on the feedback on the item, then the note taker will mark down whatever the action item or outcome was that was important.

# The environment

We've tried this at a bar or restaurant and by far the best is in the office, just before lunch on a Friday. While some people recommend 4 pm on Friday, I think this is a terrible idea. Everyone should talk, vent, get things out there, then the team should go to lunch.

# I need an escape goat

The ideal here is to talk about problems, not people. Please do not make this meeting about John. John this, John that. The meeting is about the process and the project, not individuals but rather the collective.

# Closing thoughts

These questions are helpful and powerful because they focus on what is changeable. It's about the project and software - the things that can be affected by the people in the room. It's not about snacks or the environment of the office. It's about recognizing the problems and then addressing the problems with honest, constructive, solution-oriented feedback.
