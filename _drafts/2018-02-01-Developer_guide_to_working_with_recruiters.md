Ah, the most wonderful time of the year! The snow is falling and everybody is hiring. Its a magical time to be looking for a job. If you're ever in this phase where you're looking for a new role you'll often encounter a recruiter or two along the way. This guide is to help you navigate the world of technology recruiters helping you land your next gig.

# What are the types of recruiters?

There are two kinds:

1. Corporate recruiter. These people are employed by big companies for the big company (Ex Walmart employees), they work typically just for pay like any other employee. We will not be talking about these types.

2. Staff augmentation recruiters. There are big companies like Apex or TekSystems that do staff augmentation. This is the focus of this article as this is most common.

# What is staff augmentation?

Basically a company needs more people to get a job done. They go to firms that specialize in staff augmentation to obtain people for short term or long term that have the skills they need to achieve their business goals.

Many companies will use a staff augmentation firm to find people for short term contracts (3-6 months) then hire those contractors.

# What does a recruiter do?

A recruiter networks with a bunch of different companies and hiring managers. They get hiring agreements in place for temp, fulltime or contract positions. They rather requirements that hiring managers are looking for in staff, then work those positions against Linkedin, Meetups, User groups and the broader developer community to find candidates.

In larger recruiting firms there are Account Managers who focus on client relationships and they do a lot of sales. Account Managers tend to get the client, then pass the roles and opportunities to recruiters. Recruiters go out, find people and try to get them placed.

# How do recruiters make money?

Recruiters can make lots of money. Typical for a recruiter is to earn a base salary plus a commission. According to PayScale.com recruiters average a base of around $45,000 per year.

That can be enough to barely get by, so there are different commissions:

1. The recruiter (or recruiting firm) takes 20% of your first year's ages paid out each quarter. If your salary is $100,000. The recruiter would make $5,000 per quarter for your first year. The company pays this fee.
2. The recruiter charges an hourly fee for finding and interviewing candidates. This is not very common.
3. The recruiting company acts as an employer, contracts with the client and offers you a salary or hourly contract. Say you made $50 an hour, the recruiter firm would mark that up by anywhere from 20-50% then bill the client $75/hour for every-hour you worked. In 1 year, they'd get paid $150,000 while you got $100,000.
  A. Typically in this situation the recruiter would get a few dollars an hour. The account manager would get a few more dollars an hour and the firm would make a small profit.
4. Very uncommon, but some recruiters will help you find a job, then charge YOU 20% of your first year salary. This is not common.

# Different types of recruiters

## The spam you to death recruiter

No is not in their language. I don't care if you're not interested, I have a quota to make and I just need your resume. I've had these types call me and beg for my permission to submit me to a company. I've had these types take my public resume and submit me to the company without asking.

These are the types of recruiters to not be and the type to avoid. They don't care about you, just the quota.

## Once you are on the team, I will pretend I don't even know you

## You look like a fit

## The relationship building (long term) recruiter

I only know of one person like this. One of them asks me on a regular basis to meet and coach his trainees on how to build effective relationships with other developers.
