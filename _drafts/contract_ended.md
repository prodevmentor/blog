It's been almost a month since my last post, a lot has changed. This is my story of my most recent journey and I want to share it with you today.

It was 9:30 Tuesday morning, I had called in sick a few hours before. The phone rings, its the account manager, I'm thinking to myself, 'no I can't do lunch or coffee today'. I send his call to voice mail, 30 minutes later I listen to the voice message 'Adam you need to call me right away.', huh? why? I'm out sick, lets get coffee or something next week.

I call him back, he says the words I've been afraid to hear for so long: 'Adam the client has decided to terminate your contract.'. I was in a spin, unsure of what to do or what happened. The next day I learned that more then 20 other contractors faced similar conversations. The organization downsizing or so it appears.

# Spinning out of control

I felt like I was spinning out of control. I called my wife, she said to take deep breaths and it would be ok. Within an hour of the news, after tail spinning, praying and lots of text messages between family, I had applied to Unemployment and updated my Linkedin status.

By Tuesday afternoon I was fielding 8 different options for interviews and conversations with recruiters. I picked my wife up from school and she said 'Why are you so happy? I thought I was going to deal with a husband in pieces.' Thank goodness for my wife.

# Putting the pieces together

In the intervening days, I formed an action plan. I updated my resume, got onto Dice, Indeed and Linkedin. I blasted every recruiter that I knew, 'Contract ended, on the market.'


# This is my story

This is my story, in future posts we're going to talk about what steps you need to take to ensure that you have everything you need for finding a job in the future. The process for finding a job and how to negotiate whether employed or not.
