In your career you're going to uncover many different kinds of people. The jerk that is always a saying nasty things behind your back. The lair who will stab you any chance they get. Then you'll run into mr. nice guy, who will take a beating as a door mat. You'll have crummy and good bosses. Bad companies and great ones. There are many variations to this theme. 

The most important thing you can learn in your career is how to project joy, happiness and have a good attitude. 

# Why a good attitude matters

A couple of years ago, I was working for a big medical company. We were building a new portal for our customer service team. There was this guy, he had the worst attitude ever. He would say things like, "Send me your code, and I'll fix the garbage you wrote." or "Management is a bunch of F***ing losers, startups are way better.". 

The problem was that he was really strong as a technical leader. He could work like a ninja to things done well and quickly. He was on a 6 month contract and things were going well for him, expect his attitude. 

About 3 months into his 6 month contract, he got the pink slip. People had enough of his rants of his cursing and blaming others. He never played nice.

# What does a good attitude look like

A good attitude boils down to a few things: 

1. How do you preceive the world. Are you an optimist? 
2. How you treat other people. Are you kind? Or are you hostile? 
3. How you present yourself. Do you sigh and roll your eyes when people talk?

# Having a good attitude has helped me get good jobs

My current role hired me not because I was the most technically quailifed candidate. I did have the skills, but they hired me because they felt I would bring a good attitude and positive energy to the team. 

How you present yourself goes a long way. I had a team member who during standup would sit down, roll their eyes, use their phone or other disrespectful behaviors; people found this person difficult and hard to work with. I bet you can predict the outcome. 

Remember, at work, its like dating. Present yourself the best you can. From brushing your teeth to wearing nice clothes. The language, tone, body posture and demenor you present all affect your career. The root of those things is having a good attitude. Focusing on the good parts of your job, try to assume the best out of people and most of all always be kind when possible.
